# SeaBattle
Sea battle is a game written in C++ using the sfml graphics library.
This is a coursework written in the 2nd year at the university (subject: object-oriented programming technology, 2021).  
The "Releases" folder contains a compiled project that you can run and play.   
The "code and resource" folder contains the project code, used images, fonts. The project used the sfml 2.5.1 graphics library. All images were rendered by me in the corel vector graphics editor.
